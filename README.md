## Whatâ€™s lsfMonitor?
`lsfMonitor` is an open source software for LSF information data-collection,
data-analysis and data-display.

## Python dependency
Need python3.8.8, Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh is better.    
Install python library dependency with command    

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Install
Copy install package into install directory.    
Execute below command under install directory.    

    python3 install.py

## Quick start
Execute command `bmonitor` to start lsfMonitor.    
* Below is a demo on how to track job status.

* Below is a demo on how to view server load information.

* Below is a demo on how to search license feature usage information.

## Configuration
After installing the tool, come into <LSFMONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/monitor/conf directory,
then update file config.py for your own configuration.

    db_path = ""
    lmstat_path = ""
    lmstat_bsub_command = ""

"db_path" is used to save database files, default is on <LSFMONITOR_INSTALL_PATH>/db,
you can re-point it into your own path.
"lmstat_path" is used to specify lmstat path, it is for LICENSE tab.
"lmstat_bsub_command" is used to specify LSF command for lmstat, for example, "bsub -q
normal -Is". (It is forbidden to run lmstat on login server.)

## Sample
Use monitor/bin/bsample sample job/queue/load/utilization data first, then bmonitor
can show the job/queue/load/utilization info with saved database.
Below is the suggested crontab setting on sampling data.

    SHELL=/bin/csh
    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:<BSUB_PATH>
